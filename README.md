🐍 Snake Game using Pygame

This is a classic Snake Game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game features smooth keyboard controls, real-time score tracking, and increasing difficulty as the snake grows in length. It demonstrates core game development concepts such as event handling, collision detection, game loops, and 2D graphics rendering. This project was built as a beginner-friendly game development project and as part of my game development portfolio.
